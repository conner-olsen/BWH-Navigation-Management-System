   cd BWH-Navigation-Management-System
   ```

2. **Install the project dependencies:**
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

### Running the Demo

To run the demo application, ensure that Docker is running on your machine, then use the following command:

*User selection page with Admin, and Guest options*

### Admin Login

![Admin Login Page](/docs/images/admin-login.png)
*Admin login interface with email and password fields*

Admins have access to administrative functionalities, including employee management, data upload, and viewing service logs.

Use one of the following pre-existing accounts to log in:

- **Username:** `softengc24D@gmail.com`
  <br>
  **Password:** `cs3733c24D`

- **Username:** `staffc24D@gmail.com`

  **Password:** `cs3733c24D`

Alternatively, you can create a new account by selecting the "Create Account" option. Users can sign up with their email or use an existing Google account.

### Guest Access

Guests can explore the functionalities of the site with some limitations (e.g., access to private data like node or edge data is restricted). Click the "Guest" button on the user selection page to proceed directly to the map page.

### Map Navigation

This pathfinding page displays a map of the Brigham & Women's Hospital that allows the user to zoom in, zoom out, pinch, and drag the floor map.

![Map Navigation Interface](/docs/images/map-navigation.png)
*Main map navigation interface with pathfinding controls*

#### Pathfinding Functionality

- Access the pathfinding functionality by clicking on the cursor icon (which will highlight in blue).
- Select your starting and ending locations within the hospital from the dropdown menus.
  - **Note:** You can only select the starting location from the floor you are currently viewing.
- Alternatively, select a starting and ending location by clicking directly on the location nodes on the map.

#### Floor Map Legend

- Located in the bottom right corner of the map page.
- Hover over the icon to see a legend displaying all the icons used on the floor maps.

#### Display Modes

Accessed via the display button on the bottom left side of the map.

- Customize your map view preferences:
  - Show or hide edges, nodes, halls, and location names individually or collectively.
  - Switch between a 3D map view and a heat map view.

##### Heat Map

- When selected, location icons are color-coded from green (low traffic) to red (high traffic).
- Represents the volume of pathfinding requests passing through nodes.
- The pathfinding algorithm bases the weighting of nodes on the heat map.

##### 3D Map

- **No Path Chosen:**
  - Users are directed to a 3D view page showcasing each floor.
  - Click on a specific floor to transition to the corresponding 2D view on the pathfinding page.

- **Path Chosen:**
  - An animated 3D path between floors is displayed based on the selected algorithm.
  - Features a legend explaining the meaning of each icon.
  - A toggle button is available to enable or disable the animation for pathfinding.
  - Clicking on a floor within the 3D view redirects to the corresponding floor in 2D, showcasing the animated path.
